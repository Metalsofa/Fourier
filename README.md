# Fourier (Working title) (In Development)
*An optics-based Role-Playing Game*

This repository is for all the assets related to the collaborative RPG (Role-playing-game currently) being developed by RPI students David Medlock and Devak Patel.
## Installation
If you clone this and expect it to compile and run on your computer, you'll have to update a few project properties (namely the c++ include/library directories) in the Visual Studio project properties settings tab so that they are specific to your local repository.

If you just want to test whether it can run on your computer, download DEBUG_TEST_RELEASE.zip from the 'Releases' folder and extract the contents to your directory of choice, and then try to run the executable. This is currently only supported on x64 bit architecture.

Note: There do not exist any stable releases for this game yet. The purpose of the one in the 'Releases' folder is to test whether it can be installed in its current state.

## See also
This game uses a unique vector art file format, the Fourier Graphic, or '.fgr' file. The tools to edit and manipulate these types of files are in development [here](https://github.com/Metalsofa/FGR-Suite), and help developing them is always appreciated!

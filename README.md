*An optics-based Role-Playing Game*

This repository is for all the assets related to the collaborative JRPG (Japanese Role-playing-game) currently being developed by RPI students David Medlock and Devak Patel.

If you clone this and expect it to compile and run on your computer, you'll have to update a few project properties (namely the c++ include/library directories) in the Visual Studio project properties settings tab so that they are specific to your local repository.
